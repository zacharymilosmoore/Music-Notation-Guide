Excel sheet allowing for selecting different scales, keys, and chords to display string instrument necks and keyboards

When I was learning new instruments, I was unable to find good tools for examining different keys, scales, or chords side by side, and often needed to flip back and forth between different programs.

I created this spreadsheet for fun to better showcase important keys, scales, and chords. It has the functionality to pick different scales, and then show different chords on two different string necks or a two-octave keyboard. 

Just one of the fun excel projects I had laying around!
